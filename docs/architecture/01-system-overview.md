## 2. Business Context & Domain Model

### 2.1 Product Lines Supported
The system manages four distinct product lines, each with unique requirements:

#### C-Basic Products
- **Purpose**: Entry-level product line
- **Testing Stages**: Prüfer A only
- **Characteristics**: Simplified workflow, basic quality controls

#### C2 Products  
- **Purpose**: Mid-range product line with DMG/RC/EDU/DEMO configurations
- **Testing Stages**: Prüfer A → Prüfer B → QR Preview → Label Printing
- **Characteristics**: Configuration-dependent article numbers and specifications

#### C-Pro Products
- **Purpose**: Professional product line with storage variants (256GB, 1TB, 4TB)
- **Testing Stages**: Prüfer A → Prüfer B → QR Preview → Label Printing
- **Characteristics**: Storage-dependent specifications and pricing

#### KK Products
- **Purpose**: Specialized product line
- **Testing Stages**: Prüfer A → Prüfer B → QR Preview → Label Printing
- **Characteristics**: Unique workflow with file upload capabilities

### 2.2 Core Business Processes

#### Testing Workflow

    A[Product Entry] --> B[Prüfer A Testing]
    B --> C{Product Line?}
    C -->|C-Basic| D[Direct Label Print]
    C -->|C2/C-Pro/KK| E[Prüfer B Testing]
    E --> F[QR Code Generation]
    F --> G[Label Printing]
    G --> H[Outer Karton Assembly]
```

#### Quality Control Stages
1. **Prüfer A**: Initial component testing and validation
2. **Prüfer B**: Final assembly testing and approval
3. **Label Generation**: QR code and specification printing
4. **Packaging**: Outer carton assembly with component tracking

### 2.3 User Roles & Permissions

#### Administrative Roles
- **ADMIN**: Full system access, user management, system configuration
- **MANAGEMENT**: Cross-product oversight, reporting, user supervision

#### Operational Roles
- **PRUEFER_AB**: Complete testing authority across all stages
- **PRUEFER_A**: Limited to initial testing stages
- **PRUEFER_B**: Limited to final testing and approval stages
- **VIEWER**: Read-only access for monitoring and reporting

## 3. System Architecture Vision

### 3.1 Architectural Principles

#### Modularity
- **Product-Specific Modules**: Separate routes and logic for each product line
- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI components and business logic
- **Clear Separation**: Distinct concerns for testing, printing, and management

#### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless application design
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries and indexing strategies
- **Caching Strategy**: Session-based and application-level caching

#### Security
- **Authentication**: JWT-based session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Data Protection**: Encrypted sensitive data and secure API endpoints

#### Maintainability
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing throughout the application
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable Svelte components
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive code and API documentation

### 3.2 Technology Stack Rationale

#### Frontend: SvelteKit
**Why Chosen:**
- **Performance**: Compile-time optimizations, minimal runtime overhead
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive syntax, excellent TypeScript support
- **Full-Stack**: Integrated SSR and API capabilities
- **Bundle Size**: Smaller production bundles compared to React/Vue

#### Backend: SvelteKit + Node.js
**Why Chosen:**
- **Unified Stack**: Single technology for frontend and backend
- **Type Safety**: Shared types between client and server
- **Rapid Development**: Integrated routing and API development

#### Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma
**Why Chosen:**
- **Reliability**: ACID compliance for critical quality data
- **Type Safety**: Prisma provides end-to-end type safety
- **Scalability**: Robust performance under load
- **Migrations**: Version-controlled schema evolution

#### Label Printing: ZPL (Zebra Programming Language)
**Why Chosen:**
- **Industry Standard**: Wide compatibility with industrial printers
- **Precision**: Exact positioning and formatting control
- **Reliability**: Proven technology for manufacturing environments

### 3.3 Quality Attributes

#### Performance Targets
- **Page Load Time**: < 2 seconds for all primary workflows
- **Database Response**: < 100ms for standard queries
- **Label Generation**: < 3 seconds from submission to print-ready

#### Reliability Requirements
- **Uptime**: 99.5% availability during business hours
- **Data Integrity**: Zero data loss tolerance for quality records
- **Backup Strategy**: Daily automated backups with point-in-time recovery

#### Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication capability
- **Session Management**: Secure token handling with appropriate expiration
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all quality-critical operations
